# Playground

## Launch a local playground

Play with Stimulus-use controllers locally before adding them to one of your projects.

Fork and clone the repo (SSH):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:stimulus-use/stimulus-use.git
```

Once in your local stimulus-use directory, run:
```bash
yarn install
```

Then, build the library locally
```bash
yarn build
```

Launch the playground locally (available at `http://localhost:8080/` by default):
```bash
yarn start
```
